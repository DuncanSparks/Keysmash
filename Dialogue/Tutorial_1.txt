What's going on?
What are these things?
#

[1]
I demand you release me this instant!
#

[2]
OW! Get off me, you foul creatures!
Would you mind lending a hand, sir?!
#

[3]
What did you just do?
#

[4]
I purged those vile fiends from the program.
Runtime debugging, if you will.
#

[5]
...
What are they?
They ransacked the town and took everyone away!
#

[6]
They are anomalies in the program's execution.
I'm not sure where they came from...
...But I do know that they're very impolite.
Those beasts tore me directly out of the assembly! THE NERVE!
#

[7]
Unfortunately, your friends are the least of our worries.
Those fiends could spell the end for this entire world!
If they manage to reach the hub of the program...
...they could make us all go POOF in an instant!
#

[8]
Well, we've got to stop them!
#

[9]
Yes, indeed.
Sadly, I do not have enough power to stop them myself.
I will require assistance from the end user.
#

[10]
The what?
#

[11]
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
But I will require your assistance as well.
We can drive those fiends out of this world, but only with the power of... teamwork.
#

[12]
Then let's go stop them!
Uh... what was your name again?
#

[13]
My name is Hex.
I am the staunch protector of this world, and I will not allow those beasts to destroy it!
...And yours?
#

[14]
Jatsu.
#

[15]
Then let us go, Jatsu!
Let us purge our world of these monstrous anomalies!
